# Integrated-Knowledge-AI-Technology-in-Farming
The Integarted Knowledge & AI Technology (IKAT) in Farming is the prominent technology through which data from several agricultural Fields can be collected using different sensors. THe collected data is analysed by various machine learning models to draw conclusions based on different climatic patterns, soil fertility , the nature of crops and the amount of water that needs to be supplied to the field using IOT devices. THe project mainly focuses on prediciting the appropriate crop based on climatic situations, predicting the disease of the crop , identifying the weeds in the crop , , ripeness of the fruit and the yeild of the crop based on the historic data by using supervised machine learning algorithms.
